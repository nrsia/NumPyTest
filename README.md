NumPy is a fundamental package required for high performance scientific computing and data analysis. It provides an N-dimensional array type called ndarray, which is the most important object defined in NumPy. The basic ndarray is created using the numpy.array() method. The zero() function in NumPy is used to create a matrix with all elements as 0. The output of a given code snippet in NumPy depends on the code itself. NumPy arrays can be used to perform all operations, and they can be indexed, sliced, and iterated. The reshape() method is used for changing the shape of NumPy arrays. If a dimension is given as -1 in a reshaping operation, the other dimensions are automatically calculated. The most common package used with NumPy is SciPy, which is a scientific Python package. Matplotlib is another package that is often used with NumPy for plotting. The NumPy ndarray is a fast and space-efficient multidimensional array providing vectorized arithmetic operations and sophisticated broadcasting capabilities. Whenever you see “array”, “NumPy array”, or “ndarray” in the text, they all refer to the same thing: the ndarray object.
